Overview of the project:


Task 5 STOCK MARKET ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION:

The Stock Market Analysis and Prediction project focuses on predicting future stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequential data like stock prices.

Key Objectives:
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Gather historical stock market data (e.g., closing prices, volume, etc.).
Clean and scale the data to ensure itâ€™s suitable for the model.
Data Preparation:

Convert the data into a time-series format, using past prices to predict future prices. This often involves creating sequences of data (e.g., the last 60 days of stock prices to predict the 61st day).
Building the LSTM Model:

LSTM is used to capture the temporal dependencies in stock price movements. The model learns patterns from past data and predicts future stock prices based on this learned sequence.
Model Training and Evaluation:

The model is trained on historical data and evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess prediction accuracy.
Prediction and Visualization:

After training, the model is used to predict future stock prices. Results are visualized by comparing the predicted prices with the actual prices to evaluate performance.
Challenges:
Market Volatility: Stock prices are influenced by numerous unpredictable factors, such as economic events or market sentiment, which can make predictions challenging.
Overfitting: LSTM models can sometimes memorize the training data, leading to poor generalization to unseen data.
Conclusion:
LSTM-based models can be a powerful tool for stock price prediction, but their accuracy is limited by the complex and unpredictable nature of financial markets.
